# Experimental Fall Detector Android App

## INTRODUCTION

In short: When a fall is detected the app will send an SMS to the configured emergency phone number.

## USER GUIDE

* Make sure to configure the emergency phone number for the app to call automatically when a fall is detected.
* Calls from that number will be answered automatically.
* An SMS from that number with the word POSITION in the content will be replied to automatically with the geographical position (if available).
* If the SMS contains the word ALARM instead, it will play back an alarm sound.
* The app will start automatically when the phone is turned on.
* For optimal performance (to reduce the number of false alarms and the number of undetected falls) carry the device close to your waist (a trouser pocket, a belt clip, etc.).
* Keep your device charged at all times.

Install the app by side-loading the APK file available [here](https://github.com/altermarkive/experimental-fall-detector-android-app/releases)

## 2021 UPDATE

The 2010 app was written in Java & C (both integrated via JNI and Android NDK) but I decided to port it to
Kotlin to learn the language on a practical example. A couple of other aspects had to be updated too,
including: permissions, image assets, deprecated APIs, theme, action layouts, Gradle files, etc.

The app also allows to collect & share sensor data on IPFS for research purposes (it uses [IPFS HTTP client](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/java-ipfs-http-client), rather than [a full node](https://github.com/textileio/android-ipfs-lite)).
